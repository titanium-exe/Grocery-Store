# Online Grocery Store (summer 2022)
## Team Member: Ekamleen Maan

## Project Overview

This **Online Grocery Store** project allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, and manage their purchases through an inventory management system. While the project includes basic user authentication (a password system). The project is intended to provide a basic online shopping experience with a focus on inventory management.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Users can browse a wide variety of grocery products and select items for further information and images.
- **Shopping Cart**: Allows users to add/remove items from the cart and see the total price dynamically.
- **User Authentication**: A simple password-based authentication system for user login and account management.
- **Inventory Management for Owner**: To add new products, remove, update information about products
- **Basic Security**: Implements a password system for user accounts, though no advanced security protocols are in place.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for the project.
- **JavaFX**: Used for building the graphical user interface.
- **Object Oriented Programming**

## File Structure

- `Main.java`: Entry point for the application, responsible for initializing the JavaFX interface.
- `product.java`: Defines the `Product` class with attributes such as `name`, `price`, `category`, and stock management.
- `UserInfo.java`: Handles user data, including password management.
- `scene1.java`, `scene2.java`, `scene3.java`: JavaFX scenes that handle different parts of the user interface (home, product listing, inventory).
- `WlcmPage.java`: Implements the welcome page for user login and access to the store.
